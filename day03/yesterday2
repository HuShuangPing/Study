Yesterday Once More(昨日重现) - Carpenters

When I was young

常听收音机

Waiting for my favorite songs

When they played I'd sing along

听到播放时便随声歌唱

It make me smile

Those were such happy times

How I wondered where they'd gone

我想知道他们曾去何处

But they're back again

但我所有深爱的歌曲

just like a long lost friend

他们现在又回来

All the songs I love so well

正如老友失散又重聚

Every shalala every wo'wo still shines

每一句沙-啦-啦每一句喔-喔仍闪烁

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

每一句shinga-linga-ling

that they're starting to sing so fine

他们又开始唱得如此动听

When they get to the part

where he's breaking her heart

It can really make me cry

这真能叫我哭出来

just like before

正如从前一样

It's yesterday once more

仿佛昔日又重来
